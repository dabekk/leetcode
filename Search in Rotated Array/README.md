Description
================================================
Both link 1 and 2 are the same except 1 returns index whereas 2 returns true/false depending if found.

You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.
